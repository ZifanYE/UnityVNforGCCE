Title: Next-Generation Knowledge
By 2075, the educational landscape in Japan had entered a new era. Ritsumeikan University stood at the forefront of AI technology and digitally integrated education, shaping the future of learning with innovative approaches. However, behind this progress lay unseen transformations and challenges.

The university campus had become a space where digital and reality merged, allowing students intuitive access to diverse resources. AI, drawing from countless data points, optimized each student's learning, providing a personalized educational experience. Classes transformed into immersive journeys through history via virtual reality, and every academic discipline was freely explored on a digital stage.

Among these students, Aoi was thrilled by the future of learning guided by AI. She could tackle assignments aligned with her interests, relying daily on personalized learning plans suggested by the AI. Yet, Aoi gradually began to sense underlying issues within the system. While individualized education was undeniably convenient, ethical concerns surrounding data and questions of educational disparity began to emerge.

To resolve these contradictions, Aoi visited an education-themed art exhibition held at Ritsumeikan University. There, her attention was drawn to a series of works exploring the light and shadow of digital education. The potential brought by AI, alongside the ethical challenges it created, was depicted with both beauty and intensity. Through this, Aoi realized the crucial importance of truly re-evaluating a future intertwined with AI technology.

Both within and outside the university, student communities formed, and lively ethical discussions about AI and education began to take place. Aoi, too, participated in these discussions, deepening her understanding and continually seeking her own answers. This experience propelled her to a new stage, becoming a pivotal step in pioneering next-generation knowledge.

Ritsumeikan University, with its mature AI technology, continues to explore an unknown future while drawing out the potential of each student. It is this new generation of young people, like Aoi, who will shape the very essence of such a future society.
